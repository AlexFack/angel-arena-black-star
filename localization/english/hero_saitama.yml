With one stroke.» He angrily says that he has finished his job search and is distracting the crab himself, Krabinator only beats Saitama several times, saying that he is not a hero, but only a budget, and that he has no chance against him, but it only cost Krabinator to relax, As Saitama grabs one by the eye and pulls it out, thereby defeating the crab monster. After this battle Saitama decides to become a mighty superhero, he starts a daily training schedule, which consisted of 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups and 10 km of running every day. He also ate three meals a day, but only bananas as tomorrow, and also do not use air conditioning to strengthen his moral resistance.
